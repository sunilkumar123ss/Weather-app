# Weather-app

 I've created a weather web app that allows users to check the current weather for a location of their choice. The main goal was to make it user-friendly and visually appealing. Here are the key features of the project:

Homepage:  Users can enter the name of a city or a ZIP code into a search box.

Weather Display: After entering a location and clicking the 'Get Weather' button, the app fetches the current weather data from an external weather API (in this case, OpenWeatherMap). It then displays this data in a user-friendly format.

Error Handling: We've implemented robust error handling. If a user enters an invalid location or if there's an issue with the API request, the app gracefully displays an error message and guides the user on what to do next.

Change Temp: To cater to users from different regions, we've included a change temp button . Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
